Visual Studio

1 - Copy the "TinyXML.lib" file to the project's libraries directory ( "/lib" in the examples, by default )
2 - Copy the header files (.h) to the project's includes directory ( "/includes" in the examples, by default )
3 - In solution explorer right click the project and go to "Properties => Linker => Input => Additional dependencies" and add "tinyxml.lib" ( all libs must be separated by ; )
4 - Take a look at the example class "XMLScene" to better understand what you need to do.
Eclipse

In order to use TynyXML with eclipse you need to first build the library file from TynyXML source code.
1 - Download TinyXML source code from http://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyxml/
2 - Create a new project using the source (.cpp) and header (.h) files
3 - In project explorer, right click the project and go to "Project => Properties => C/C++ Build => Settings => Build Artifact"
4 - Set Artifact Type as "Static Library", Artifact Extension as "a" and Artifact Name as "${ProjName}"
5 - Build the project and the library file will be generated in the output folder
6 - Use the generated library file in your project by adding it to your project's libraries folder
Other IDEs

The process is fairly similar to the Eclipse aproach. Use the TinyXML source code and build the library file so you can use it in your own project.
